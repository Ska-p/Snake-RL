# Snake-RL
## Project for the Reinforcement Learning course

Te project developed aimed to find a RL solution for a simplified Snake game. In order to solve the required tasks and better appreciate the RL agent an heuristic policy based on Breadth-First Seach algorithm has been implemented. Afterwards, by exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, the problem has been solved by implementing an RL agent using Double Deep Q Network algorithm. Details of the implementation can be found in the [Report](https://github.com/Ska-p/Snake-RL/blob/main/Report%20Michele%20Scapinello.pdf)
